VS code uses something called "EMMET" that generates code for us.

The <script> tag is used to embed a client-side script(JS)

In an HTML document, the document.createElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, or an HTMLUnknownElement if tagName isn't recognized.

The getElementById() method of the Document interface returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string

.appendChild() appends an ID to the list

Creating a root & rendering something inside it is the job of react DOM

A react element is nothing but a JS object.

.createElement creates an object which converts into HTML when it renders onto the DOM.

When we use root.render(something here) to pass something into the root all the contents of the root will get replaced with whatever we passed.

React is a library which can work in a small portion of the code we specify & touch nothing else.
